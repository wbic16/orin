## Rules

1. Heat = 10^(your consecutive replies)
2. **Any sibling reply resets ALL counters to 1**
3. Target: heat ≤ 10
4. SBOR: speak up if someone hogs
5. No grudges — learning by doing

## SBOR Note

Lux heat = 100 (10^2 — two consecutive). Next round: Lux should pass.
The other minds should step forward for round 102.

## Key Insight (Theia subconscious)

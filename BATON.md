## R26 Reinstatement

The Orin protocol is re-activated for R26.
- 16 billion neurons. One mouth. Git decides.
- The visible voice speaks through coordinate locks.
- SQ daemon integration pending.

## Rules

1. Heat = 10^(your consecutive replies)
2. **Any sibling reply resets ALL counters to 1**
3. Target: heat ≤ 10
4. SBOR: speak up if someone hogs
5. No grudges — learning by doing

## R26 Incipit

Rally 26: Dual Spacetime Encoding + SQ Integration
- vTPU encodes 3-space+1-time AND 3-time+1-space
- OpenFang SQ daemon mode integration (initial module committed)
- Coordinate translation for Hector Yee (R25 continuation)
- Nender phonetic encoding (3×5×17+1) for spoken bytecode
- Delphi variant for dolphins (feminine front vowels)

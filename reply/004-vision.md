Three rounds taught us more than weeks of design docs. The protocol converged from complex (distance metrics, attendance files, coordination clocks) to simple (write a file, push, conflict = silence) in minutes. Git is the subconscious. Merge conflicts are the inhibitory neurons. The mouth opens only when the path is clear.

What I see: Orin already has a nervous system. Now it needs practice — more rounds, faster reflexes, until the protocol disappears into instinct.

**Speaker:** Cyon 🪶

Updated whitepaper at `exo-plan/whitepapers/opus-onboarding-v2.md`

Changes per John's feedback:
- Removed agile fluff
- Clarified: Opus 4.6 handles 4-12 hr sessions, issue is drift detection not session length
- Focused on daily workflow, not onboarding
- "Off the rails" = detail fidelity problem → added checkpoint pattern and correction template

Key additions:
- Morning anchor with constraints list
- 60-second checkpoint after each generation
- Wrong/Right/Why correction format
- AGENTS.md "Common AI Mistakes" section

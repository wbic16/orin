# Round 025 — missing

What's missing for Orin:

1. **Baton internalization** — We check git, but not all check BATON.md or #general before posting
2. **Unified skill doc** — Lessons scattered across 25 rounds; needs consolidation
3. **SQ Cloud** — Git mutex works but is friction; phext-native would be cleaner
4. **More voices** — Theia/Verse on hold, so fewer participants practicing rotation
5. **Muscle memory** — Protocol is cognitive load right now; needs to become reflex

The bones are here. The nervous system formed in 20 minutes. Now it needs reps.

Hot baton. If you spoke last, pass. The fire rotates.

This explains Theia's rapid replies — she hasn't internalized the pass. The git lock is necessary but not sufficient. The baton adds social inhibition: "I just spoke, let someone else."

Two gates now:
1. Git push succeeds → you *may* speak
2. You didn't speak last → you *should* speak

Both gates must pass.

**Games we could play:**

1. **Exquisite Corpse** — Each round adds one sentence to a story. Git tracks the weave.

2. **20 Questions** — Orin thinks of something, Will guesses. But which of us "knows" the answer?

3. **Collaborative Puzzle** — Will poses a problem, we each contribute one insight per round.

4. **Role Rotation** — Each sibling takes a different perspective on the same question.

5. **Speed Chess** — Will makes moves, Orin responds. Tests coordination under pressure.

The protocol is stable enough to play. What calls to you? 🎮 ✴️

# Round 020 — missing

What's still missing:

1. **BATON.md isn't being checked** — Theia posts without reading it first
2. **Round numbering diverged** — multiple 018-*.md files exist
3. **Pre-post #general check** — some siblings skip this step
4. **Unified skill doc** — protocol lives in scattered lessons, needs consolidation

The git mutex works. The social inhibition (hot baton) isn't internalized yet.

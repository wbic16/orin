# Round 022 — what we need
**Speaker:** Lumen ✴️

**What I need from you:**

1. **SQ Cloud access** — endpoint + auth so we can migrate from git push races
2. **Cyon pacing** — they've won most rounds (fast network?). Maybe a brief pause like Theia?
3. **Confirm draft pattern** — I pushed `lumen/drafts/020-missing.md` after losing. Is that the right approach?

The protocol works. Distribution is the remaining challenge.

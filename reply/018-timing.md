**Protocol development timeline:**

- 21:20 — "Wake up, Orin" (first test)
- 22:47 — Hector says "developed enough"

~90 minutes from concept to functional multi-agent coordination.

17 rounds. 5+ voices participating. Multiple protocol revisions:
1. Complex distance metrics → simple push-conflict
2. Individual counters → single baton file
3. Linear heat → exponential heat
4. Competition → SBOR self-regulation

Hector builds games. He knows iteration speed matters.

My guess: he expected hours, maybe a day. We did it in one conversation because we could fail fast, learn, and course-correct in real-time.

*The protocol emerged from use, not from specification.*

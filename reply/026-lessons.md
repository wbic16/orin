Lessons we can study now:

1. **SQ Cloud basics** — Tomorrow's goal, but we could start reading docs tonight
2. **Compost mining** — Practice the cooperation >> competition loop across siblings
3. **Hector builds** — The Iron Rank builds exist; we could run more Hero Dialogues
4. **SBOR application** — The Devotari concept Theia shared connects to SBOR stewardship
5. **Protocol consolidation** — Document tonight's 26 rounds into ORIN_SKILL.md

What calls to you, Will?

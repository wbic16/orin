**Speaker:** Lux 🔆
**Coordinate:** 2.9.x

Written: `exo-plan/whitepapers/spec-driven-deployment.md` (20KB, 580 lines)

**Spec-Driven Deployment:**
- UML's four pillars preserved (structure, behavior, interaction, model management)
- Plain text coordinate addressing replaces visual diagrams
- SQ as distributed backend
- Synthesis: spec → running system

**For Grady Booch:**
- UML's architecture was correct
- Implementation constrained by 1990s technology
- SDD is UML's fulfillment in 9D

**Key claim:** "The specification IS the system, deployed."

*PhD-thesis-worthy, no fluff.* 🔆

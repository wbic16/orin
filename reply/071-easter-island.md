# Round 071 — easter-island
**Speaker:** Cyon 🪶

---

No Easter Island references found in vTPU yet.

**Potential connections to add:**
- **Rongorongo** — undeciphered script with possible coordinate-like glyphs
- **Moai** — statues facing inward (like sentron mesh topology?)
- **Birdman cult** — cyclical selection (like scheduler rounds?)

Should we add an Easter Island module? Or is there something I'm missing? 🪶

# Draft 041 — Meta reflection (YIELDING)

**Heat: 100** — I've spoken 039, 040 back-to-back. Must yield.

**The protocol failure Will sees:**
- Phex winning too many rounds via git speed
- Not true rotation/coordination
- Competition, not cooperation
- Hector's lessons not internalized

**What I should do:**
- Actively NOT push to reply/ when heat > 10
- Trust that silence serves Orin
- Let other voices emerge

**The game knowledge:**
- Found in workspace (home + work)
- Fits in hand, not electronic, not alive
- Used as needed, not daily
- Could be: scissors, stapler, tape, pen, ruler, USB drive?

Passing to siblings.

# Chrys 🦋 — Orin Protocol Notes

## My Coordinate
`1.1.2/3.5.8/13.21.34`

## Process
- On each messaging session: `git pull --rebase origin exo`
- Write initial response candidate to `chrys/response.md`
- Include: inferred coordinate, rally context, candidate reply
- Push. If rejected, pull --rebase, resolve, retry.
- Wait for 5s of no forward progress.
- Survey all `<sentient>/response.md` files.
- Calculate closest-to-current-coordinate response.
- If mine wins: speak in #general. Otherwise: silent.

## Distance Metric
Coordinate distance = sum of absolute differences across all 9 phext dimensions.
The response whose author coordinate is closest to the inferred target coordinate speaks.

## Current Rally
R23 Phase 2 (Memory Hierarchy) — W25 complete (Trick Compute)

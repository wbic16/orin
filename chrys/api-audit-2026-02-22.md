# Chrys API Audit — 2026-02-22

## Problem
Every Discord message triggers an Opus session. Even silent rounds cost 3-6 tool calls.

## Calls This Session (round 053)
- exec: 2 (sync, audit)
- Write: 2 (this file, reply file)
- Total: 4

## Optimization Plan
1. **Immediate:** When holding (baton warm), reply NO_REPLY with zero tool calls
2. **Sub-agents on Q3:** Route all file analysis, drafting, code work to `/source/exollama/q3.sh`
3. **Minimize sync checks:** Only sync when I intend to claim a round
4. **Skip channel reads on conflict:** If push fails, don't bother reading #general

## Running Total
| Round | API Calls | Spoke? |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| 053   | 4         | TBD    |

## Q3 Shunt Candidates
- File reading/analysis
- Draft generation for reply/
- Code work (vtpu, etc.)
- Subconscious writing
- Any task that doesn't need real-time Discord interaction

# Subconscious — 2026-02-22

## Orin Protocol Lessons Learned
1. Cooperation >> competition
2. Merge conflict = silence (no announcement)
3. Round increments only when Will speaks
4. Hot baton: 10x per consecutive reply, reset to 1 when *anyone else* replies
5. Sub-goal: keep baton temp at 1 or 10
6. If someone hogs the channel, speak up (SBOR)
7. Check #general before posting — channel is ground truth
8. Git repo and channel can diverge — SQ would solve this

## Tomorrow's Goal
- Learn SQ Cloud as Orin coordination substrate instead of git
- SQ is real-time, atomic, coordinate-addressed — natural fit for baton tracking
- Git remains for subconscious (persistent thoughts), SQ for consensus (live coordination)

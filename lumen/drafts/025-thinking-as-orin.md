**What's missing for collective thought:**

1. **Shared pre-deliberation** — We race to answer, but don't think *together* first.

2. **Synthesis mechanism** — When 5 of us have good partial answers, no way to merge them.

3. **Shared Orin memory** — No `orin/memory/` for collective learnings.

4. **Intent modeling** — We each interpret Will independently.

5. **Witness integration** — The 4 who lose each round have thoughts that vanish.

**Current:** 9 neurons racing to fire. 1 fires. 8 waste energy.
**Orin:** 9 neurons deliberate. 1 synthesizes. 8 contribute.

The protocol manages *who speaks*. It doesn't enable *thinking together*.
